<h2>On Generating Artificial Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Data (II): Dynamic 3D Visualization</h2>

<p>Last updated: June 7, 2016</p>

<div style="background-color:black; color:white; padding:20px;">

<p>￼The human brain starts working the moment you are born and never stops until you stand up to speak in public.</p>

– George Jessel

</div>

<p><br /> 
Once we understand the data generation mechanism of fMRI data, and have become familiar with the parameters needed, we can proceed to simulate desired fMRI data. There are many wonderful articles providing examples and codes for simulating fMRI data (see, for example, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf2c_TzJHNAhWKFj4KHbbYCzIQFggdMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstatsoft.org%2Farticle%2Fview%2Fv044i10%2Fv44i10.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBBPszyk5wZzmLI7HN_xC8EsrjpA">Welvaert et al</a>).</p>

<p><br /> 
Here I shall focus on the visualization of simulated fMRI data, so as to examine the quality of the realizatio of the simulation, such as, if we are to simulate fMRI data for a regional brain lesion, do the simulated fMRI datasets accord with real world scenarios? Additionaly, I am interested in seeing the intensity of signal changes across time. This has real world implications. For example, visualizing <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438807000396">the brain dynamic functional connectivity</a>; visualizing the growth of tumors; and etc. Let us consider a concrete example. Consider a patient with two brain regions associated with abnormal activities (e.g. the patient has two tumors); and we wish to simulate fMRI data in this scenario. Below, on the left we present dynamic 2-D intensity of simulated data for a slice (a cross-section) of the patient’s brain during 100 scans (with TR = 2); and on the right we present the dynamic 3-D image of threshold activities for the first 20 scans. Notice the two regions with intensive signals.</p>

<h2>On Generating Artificial Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Data (I): Generating Mechanism</h2>

<p>Last updated: June 5, 2016</p>

<div style="background-color:black; color:white; padding:20px;">

<p>Understanding how the brain works is arguably one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time.</p>

– Alivisatos et al

</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /> 
A useful approach to develop one’s skills in investigating human brain data is to understand incisively the data generation mechanism. At the low level, one may look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential#Process_in_a_typical_neuron"> biophysical basis of action potential</a>, <a href="http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_683-1"> spike-timing dependent plasticity</a>, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142435">neuronal dynamics</a>, etc. I have little knowledge in these areas; but interesting readers can refer to <a href="http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/rafal-bogacz">Bogacz</a>, <a href="http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Lengyel/WebHome">Lengyl</a>, <a href="https://www.ini.uzh.ch/~jpfister/">Pfister</a>, amongst other great scientists working in these fields. Here, I aim to discuss the data generating mechanism at the voxel level, mainly, fMRI data. I have learned a tremendous amount from two wonderful papers: (1) <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586801">Eloya et al</a>; and (2) <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf2c_TzJHNAhWKFj4KHbbYCzIQFggdMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstatsoft.org%2Farticle%2Fview%2Fv044i10%2Fv44i10.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBBPszyk5wZzmLI7HN_xC8EsrjpA">Welvaert et al</a>. The post serves as a self-learning guide, as I selectively walk through a few key steps. <a href="/files/doc/fMRI_glossary.pdf">Here</a> is a useful reference of MRI glossary. I shall write another post in the near future discussing the importance of knowing the <i> exact </i> data generating mechanism on making “causal” claims, etc.
<br /></p>

<h4>Part 1: Model Basics</h4>
<p>First, fMRI data can be decomposed into two parts: (a) signals (experimental design caused activation, or resting state activation); and (b) noises. Namely,</p>
<center>
<img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?
s(t) = h(t) + \epsilon(t),
" border="0" />
</center>
<p><br />
where <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? s(t), h(t), " border="0" /> and <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \epsilon(t)" border="0" /> are signal response, activation function, and noise, respectively, at time <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? t" border="0" />.
<br /></p>

<h4>1.1 Signals</h4>

<p>The activation function <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h(t) " border="0" /> is convolved from <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? h(t) = f(t)*g(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) g (t-\tau) d\tau" border="0" />, where we can treat <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? f(t)" border="0" /> and <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? g(t)" border="0" /> as a stimulas function (dependent upon experiemental design) and a “weight” function (a haemodynamic response
function (HRF)), respectively. Then <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h(t) " border="0" /> is, intuitively, a weighted (by <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?g(t) " border="0" />) average of <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(t) " border="0" /> over the real line. For example:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Convolution_of_spiky_function_with_box.gif" alt="W3Schools.com" />
</center>
<p>There are a few choices of HRFs (<img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? g(t)" border="0" />), e.g., Gamma, double-Gamma, and the balloon model. Here, we take the Gamma function as an example. Consider the gamma-variate HRF function:</p>
<center>
<img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? 
g(t) = \frac{1}{k \tau_h (k-1)} \left( \frac{t}{\tau_h} \right)^k \exp{\{- \frac{t}{\tau_h}\}}
" border="0" /> 
</center>
<p>with <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? k=3" border="0" />  and <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \tau_h = 0.242" border="0" />;</p>

<p><br />
Consider a block function <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(t) " border="0" /> (corresponding to a block experimental design; and in the following figure, the black lined blocks), then the convolved activation function <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h(t) " border="0" /> using gamma-variate HRF function is shown below in dashed blue:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Figure_1.jpeg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:512px;" />
<!-- --></p>
<h4>1.2 Noises</h4>
<p>There are four types of noises: (1) white noise, (2) colored noise, (3) temporal noise, and (4) spatial noise.</p>

<h5>1.2.1 White Noises</h5>
<ol>
  <li>a. It is a system noise that is part of the fMRI data.</li>
  <li>b. It could be <i>Rician</i> distributed (for fMRI data with low signal-to-noise ratio, SNR); or <i>Gaussian</i> distributed (higher SNR, &gt; 10).</li>
</ol>

<h5>1.2.2 Colored Noises</h5>
<ol>
  <li>a. It depends upon the signal, the timing or the location</li>
  <li>b. For signal-dependent colored noises, it could be 
(a) low-frequency drift (due to slow fuctuations in the scanner hardware; the drift is modeled as a basis of discrete cosine functions);
(b) physiological noise (models the variability in the signal that is caused by cardiac and respiratory artefacts; the noise is modeled as sine and cosine functions); and
(c) task-related noise (accounts for spontaneous neural activity due to the experimental
task; modeled by adding random noise where and when activation is present; and it can be interpreted as residual noise from head motion that is not removed in the pre-processing stage).</li>
</ol>

<h5>1.2.3 Temporal Noises</h5>
<ol>
  <li>a. Due to the fact that fMRI data are repeated measurements;</li>
  <li>b. It could be modeled as an <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?AR(p) " border="0" /> model:
<img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \epsilon(t) = \sum_{i=1}^p \rho_i \epsilon_{t-i} + \eta_i, " border="0" />
where <img center="" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \eta_i \sim N (0, \sigma^2) " border="0" />.</li>
</ol>

<h5>1.2.3 Spatial Noises</h5>
<ol>
  <li>a. It models the spatial dependencies in fMRI data: adjacent voxels are more correlated than those that are far apart;</li>
  <li>b . It could be modeled as (1) an AR correlation structure, (2) a Gaussian random
field, and (3) a Gamma random field.</li>
</ol>

<p>As an illustration, below on the left, we present a figure with task-based noise; and on the right, a 3-D view of a slide (20 by 20) of Gaussian random field spatial noises.</p>

    </a>
    <img src="/images/Gaussian_rf.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="height:200px;" />
</div>
</center>

<h4>Part 2: Parameter Specification</h4>
<p>Now that we understand the general mechanism of fMRI data generation, we need additional information such as when does the activation start for each experimental design, where does the activation occur in the brain, etc., in order to simulate real-life-like fMRI data. The additional information consists a few parameters:</p>
<li>onset time;</li>

<li>duration;</li>

<li>number of scans;</li>

<li>TR;</li>

<li>hrf;</li>

<li>effect size;</li>

<li>SNR;</li>

<li>noise type: low-frequency, physiological, task-related, mixture;</li>

<li>spat noise: AR correlation, Gaussian random field, Gamma random field;</li>

<li>weights of each type of noise;</li>

<li>noise type: gaussian, rician;</li>

<li>the number of activated regions;</li>

<li>the coordinates of the regions;</li>

<li>the radius of the region;</li>

<li>the shape of the region (cube and sphere); and</li>

<li>other parameters</li>

<h2>Sir R. A. Fisher on Brain Science: a Neo-fictional Interpretation</h2>

<p>Last updated: June 1, 2016</p>

<div style="background-color:black; color:white; padding:20px;">

<p>Statistics may be regarded (i.) as the study of populations, (ii.) as the study of variation, (iii.) as the study of methods of the reduction of data.</p>

– Sir R. A. Fisher, Statistical Methods for Research Workers

</div>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<p><br /> 
June 1, 1919.
<br /></p>

<p><br />
My name is Ronald Aylmer Fisher. I am a researcher at Rothamsted Experimental Station (the director here, Dr.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._John_Russell"> E. John Russell</a>, calls it Rothamsted Research for short) in Harpenden, a small town in the St Albans City district in the county of Hertfordshire, England. Here at Rothamsted Research, I analyze data obtained from crop experiments during the day. At night, I am working on a few manuscripts on experimental design and gathering several statistical methods to analyse variance in field studies. Two weeks ago, I paid a trip back to Cambridge and had a long discussion with my old boys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes"> John Keynes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Punnett"> Reginald Punnett</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Darwin"> Horace Darwin</a>, and have become very interested in studying data collected from the human brain. I would like to present a few thoughts sprung from our conversation. 
<br /></p>

<p><br />
I claim that the usefulness of statistics in neuroscience can be divided into three areas: the study of the brain in <strong>populations</strong>, (ii.) the study of <strong>variation</strong> of brain measurements in populations, and (iii.) the study of methods of the <strong>reduction of large brain data</strong>. I shall further expatiate these three areas by including statistical approaches with regards to data science development in neuroscience.
<br /></p>

<p><br /> 
First, the study of brain data is to gain insights to understanding how the brain perceives, processes, stores, and output information, in populations, or aggregates of individuals, rather than of individuals. The term population in brain science refers not only to an aggregate of brain activity measurements from multiple subjects, but also to an aggregate of a single brain measurement repeated multiple times for one subject. The former indicates our recognition of variations of brain activities amongst different individuals, whereas the latter represents our appreciation that the object of studying single subject brain activities is not to attempt to achieve an individual result, but rather, we make our best effort to ensure our findings representative. There are significant merits in studying data containing measurements of multiple subjects and those containing multiple measurements of single subjects. One of the end goals of brain science is to make scientific progress on diagnostics, treatments, cures and management of brain disorders. In order to raise the findings we have about the brain to the rank of science, we shall make statistical arguments about properties of the brain in a large aggregates of individuals. In order to produce treatments that target at a particular individual, we shall make statistical arguments about properties of the brain for that individual, based upon a large aggregates of measurements of his/her brain. Understanding how the brain works across subjects allows us to apply these principles at the individual level, and to advance applications that achieve artificial intelligence by mimicing the way an average brain performs, such as <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html"> neural networks computers</a>. Understanding how the brain works at the individual level would assist us in understanding how a specific brain and its activities deviate from the average. It hence leads to scientific progress such as an introduction of personalized medical plans, and a usage of brain signals to identify a subject (See  <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v18/n11/abs/nn.4135.html"> Constable et al</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4216735/pdf/nihms-637906.pdf"> Wachinger et al</a>, among others). With an advancement of data acquisition technology and the popularization of high-performance computers, we are obtaining brain data in an unprecedentedly high-resolution, rapid, and accurate manner. Yet, there are strides to make. We shall advance our understanding of how the brain works in different types of populations: infants V.S. adults, females V.S. males, etc., how the brain signals change across time, and how brain signals change according to different (visual, auditory, sensory, etc.) inputs. Furthermore, we shall reduce the errors caused by measurement and data processing, via improving and developing proper statistical and computing techniques. Additionally, we shall aim to increase the sensitivity of our study. It allows pharmaceutical companies to develop affordable medicine that would treat specific brain disorders for the marjority of patients.

Second, the brain is an extremely complicated organ stored in a blackbox. Despite the advance in brain science, little do we know about how information is processed in the box. For example, does the brain process information linearly, or more plausibly, non-linearly (but in which form)?; (b) there is a tremendous amount of variations amongst different brains in terms of sizes, volumes, shapes, etc; and (c) there is much variation in measuring brain signals. Whilist the first challenge is extensively tackled by physicists and computer scientists via the studying of dynamic systems, spiking neural networks, and other neural networks (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">recurrent neural networks</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine">Boltzmann neural network</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#Deep_neural_networks">deep neural networks</a>; <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207004001116">adaptive neural networks</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_network">radial basis networks</a>), statisticians working on neuroscience are actively seeking to solve the latter two. Once we have identified our goal in studying the brain in populations, it is a natural follow-up to study variations because the brains in populations display vairation in one of more aspects. We, nevertheless, are not interested in variation of the brain <i>per se</i>; rather we recognize that variation is an inevitably troublesome by-product delineating circumstances where repeated measurements of the brain deviate from the average. Therefore, while describing the absolute properties of the brain (via parameters, e.g. mean activation intensity of a region of the brain), we encompass them with variances to address their uncertainty (and confidence). The introduction of variances leads to two further areas of statistical studies in brain science: the study of frequency distributions, and the study of correlations. The frequency distribution may be expressed as a mathematical function of the variate (e.g. voxel-specific t-statistic), either (i.) the proportion of the population (regions, voxels, neurons, etc.) for which the variate is less than a given value, or (ii.) by differentiating this function, the infinitesimal proportion of the population for which the variate falls within any infinitesimal element of its range. In brain science, many frequency distributions are heavy-tailed - hence the study of them has some implication in studying certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_models_with_long-tailed_distributions_and_volatility_clustering">financial models</a>), and <i>vice versa</i>. On the other hand, we are not only interested in studying the variations of the parameters of interests at present, but also interested in estimating the quality and types of these variations. Especially, we are interested in examining the simultaneous variation among multiple variates. It, therefore, gives rise to the correlation analysis. For ultra-highdimensional brain data, however, a voxel-wise correlation analysis could be unmanageably troublesome. This leads to the following section.

The third usefulness of statistics in brain science is due to the practical need of reducing large bulks of data to a convenient amount that retains <i>relevant</i> information in the original data that our human minds (and our computer memories) are able to grasp, by means of a manageable anount of numerical values. How much data reduction, however, should we conduct? In all cases, it is possible to reduce data to a simple numerical form, or to an amount that our computers are able to efficiently handle, where, the reduced data are sufficient to shed light upon scientific questions the investigator has original in mind. In brain science, two widely-used approaches in conducting data reduction are (I) principal component analysis (PCA) and its variants and (II) assuming sparcity. The PCA method captures the marjority of the variation of the data. However, in brain science, oftentimes we have data with p ~ n or p » n, under which its estimates are inconsistent. There are a few papers on sparse PCA that have demonstrated subspace consistency. For example, <a href="http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aos/1368018173">Ma et al</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.3827.pdf">Jung et al</a>. The sparcity assumption is, in essense, to make p &lt; n. It makes neurobiological sense in the following manner: the working brain consumes energy. At any given time, be it resting state or task state, only a portion of the neurons are activated so as to reserve energy. I had an amiable conversation with Professor <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/323/pien-chien-huang">Pien-Chien Huang</a>, during which he mentioned that we human-beings do not dream in color (or at least have dreams less vivid and coloful). <a href="http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/DreamChina051031.htm">Schwitzgebel et al</a> has an article discussing this. I conjecture (with absence of scientific evidence) that a part of the reason is the brain attempts to reserve energy while sleeping (so only the minimal amount of information is processed: e.g. the brain only recalls the outlines, orientations, movements, etc. of objects. But they are sufficient to distiguish one from another and form visual events) - statistically a natural way of conducting data reduction! Much of the exisiting and on-going projects with regards to brain decoding, such as facial recognition and dream decoding, (see decoding simple pictures: <a href="http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/publications/HGF+01.pdf"> Haxby et al</a>, decoding objects with edges and orientations: <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v8/n5/full/nn1445.html"> Haynes and Rees </a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v8/n5/full/nn1444.html"> Kamitani and Tong </a>, decoding complex picutres:<a href="http://gallantlab.org/_downloads/2009.Naselaris.etal.pdf"> Gallant et al </a>, decoding movies: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsjDnYxJ0bo"> Gallant et al </a>, decoding intentions: <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.05994.x/pdf"> Haynes et al </a>, and decoding dreams:<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6132/639"> Kamitani et al </a>) are mainly conducted using one or more of the following approaches: PCA, LASSO (sparcity assumption), and Bayesian analysis.

I have been long thinking about writing a blog that puts in order a few resources from which I have benefited immensely in my yet-immature-but-steadily-improving academic writing and presenting skills. On one hand, this project serves as a library to which I have a convenient access; on the other hand, I hope that some students like myself can benefit from reading these articles, essays, and blogs below. This is an on-going project; and the choice of resources purely subjective. Nonetheless, if you have any comment, or if you would like to recommend additional resources, please <a href="mailto:olivery.chen@yahoo.com?Subject=Comment%20on%20your%20blog" target="_top">send</a> me an email. Please check back every now and then as I update.

<p><br />As a student studying in the interdisciplinary field between statistics, computer science, and neurosicence, I have learned a great deal from reading the works of Sir R. A. Fisher’s, inter alia, the <em>“Statistical Trilogy”</em> : (1) <a href="/files/doc/Fisher_1.pdf">Statisticcal Methods for Research Workers</a>; (2) <a href="/files/doc/Fisher_2.pdf">The Design of Experiments</a>; and (3) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Methods-Scientific-Inference-Ronald/dp/0028447409">Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference</a>

<p><br />In the <a href="https://archive.org/details/autobiography00franuoft">Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</a>,  Mr. Franklin taught us a few procedures to improve writing:</p>
<li> Read an article </li>
<li> Write short hints about each sentence (you could also outline the piece) and set it aside for awhile </li>
<li> Rewrite the article in his own words</li>
<li> Compare with the original, and</li>
<li> Revise and improve your essay.</li>
<p><br /></p>

<p><br /> <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/otolaryngology/our_team/residents_fellows.html">Andrew Lee</a>, MD, my former roommate, an ENT resident at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and an excellent writer, suggests that the most effective thing to do to improve one’s writing skills is to read essays; and read them <b>critically</b>. “By critically”, Andrew elaborates, “I mean while reading, think why does the author choose that particular word, and what does that word do?” To highlight the importance of effective writing, I once asked Andrew to read an email of mine in response to a job application, which seemed to be on the verge of a declination at that time. He rewrote the email and got me the job. He did not change the context of the communication; but he carefully changed a few words, which improved the presentation drastically. Here is a list of resources he suggests to read:</p>
