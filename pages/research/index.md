## Principal Direction of Mediation

Mediation analysis has become an important tool in the behavioral sciences for investigating
the role of intermediate variables that lie in the path between a randomized treatment
and an outcome variable.

The three-variable path diagram used to represent the multivariate mediation framework. The variables corresponding to Z and Y are scalars, while the variable corresponding to M is a ultra-high dimensional vector. The influence of the intermediate variable on the outcome is often determined using structural equation models (SEMs), with model coefficients interpreted as effects. However little work has been done on mediation analysis when the intermediate variable (mediator) is a highdimensional vector. As a motivating example, consider a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of thermal pain where we are interested in determining which brain measurements (over hundreds of thousands of voxels) mediate the relationship between the application of a thermal stimulus and self-reported pain. To address the problem of high dimensional mediators in the context of linear SEMs, we propose a framework called the principal direction of mediation (PDM).

## By-variate Longitudinal Functional Data Analysis

Objective measurement of physical activity using wearable devices such as accelerometers provides detailed information on patterns and intensities of daily physical activity, which can be potential biomarkers of human aging. Accelerometers record quasi-continuous activity information for many days and for hundreds of individuals. For example, in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, daily physical activity was recorded for about 300 adults during each visit for several days and each subject has two to four visits. An interesting problem that naturally arises is how to quantify daily physical activity patterns change with age, gender, body mass index, among other covariates. We propose a longitudinal functional data model where the parameters of interest are bivariate functions of time and age.

## Packages

I am the Author and Maintainer of the follows packages. 

#### Principal Direction of Mediation (PDM)
* `PDM`: The package provides functions that calculate the estimates of the Principal Direction of Mediations (PDMs) and corresponding path coefficients of ultra-high dimensional data, provided treatment (e.g. thermal pain), response (e.g. reported pain), and mediation data (e.g. measurements of fMRI data).
