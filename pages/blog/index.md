<h2>Sir R. A. Fisher on Brain Science: a Fictional Interpretation</h2>

Jun 1, 2016

<div style="background-color:black; color:white; padding:20px;">

<p>Understanding how the brain works is arguably one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time.</p>

â€“ Alivisatos et al.

</div> 

<br> In the introductory of Sir R. A. Fisher's epic book [Statisticcal Methods for Research Workers](/files/Fisher_1.pdf), he introduced that Statistics may be regarded as <i>(i.) the study of populations, (ii.) as the study of variation, (iii.) as the study of methods of the reduction of data.</i>

<h2>On Scientific Writing and Presentation</h2>

May 1, 2016

<div style="background-color:black; color:white; padding:20px;">

<p>If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead, either write something worth reading or do things worth writing.</p>

- Benjamin Franklin

I have been long thinking about writing a blog that puts in order a few resources from which I have benefited immensely in my yet-immature-but-steadily-improving academic writing and presenting career. On one hand, this project serves as a library to which I have a convenient access; on the other hand, I hope that some students like myself can benefit from reading these articles, essays, and blogs below. This is an on-going project; and the choice of resources purely subjective. Nonetheless, if you have any comment, or if you would like to recommend additional resources, please <a href="mailto:olivery.chen@yahoo.com?Subject=Comment%20on%20your%20blog" target="_top">send</a> me an email. Please check back every now and then as I update.

<br>[This aritical](/files/doc/scientific_writing.pdf) is recommended by Professor [Andreas Buja](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~buja) as "an article everybody should read" on scientific reading. Here is a [summary version](/files/doc/summary.pdf) of it.
<br/>

<br>[The Elements of Style](/files/doc/Style.pdf) teaches concise and vigorous English writing.
<br/>

<br>Professor [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com) gives good advice on effective presentation [here](/files/doc/Presentation_Leek.pdf).
<br/>

<br>As a student studying in the interdisciplinary field between statistics, computer science, and neurosicence, I have learned a great deal from reading the works of Sir R. A. Fisher's, inter alia, the <em>"Statistical Trilogy"</em> : (1) [Statisticcal Methods for Research Workers](/files/Fisher_1.pdf); (2) [The Design of Experiments](/files/Fisher_2.pdf); and (3) [Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference](http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Methods-Scientific-Inference-Ronald/dp/0028447409)
<br/>


<br>In the [Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin](https://archive.org/details/autobiography00franuoft),  Mr.Franklin taught us a few procedures to improve writing:
<li> Read an article </li>
<li> Write short hints about each sentence (you could also outline the piece) and set it aside for awhile </li>
<li> Rewrite the article in his own words</li>
<li> Compare with the original, and</li> 
<li> Revise and improve your essay.</li>
<br />

<br> <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/otolaryngology/our_team/residents_fellows.html">Andrew Lee</a>, MD, my former roommate, an ENT resident at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and an excellent writer, suggests that the most effective thing to do to improve one's writing skills is to read essays; and read them <b>critically</b>. "By critically", Andrew elaborates, "I mean while reading, think why does the author choose that particular word, and what does that word do?" To highlight the importance of effective writing, I once asked Andrew to read an email of mine in response to a job application, which seemed to be on the verge of a declination at that time. He rewrote the email and got me the job. He did not change the context of the communication; but he carefully changed a few words, which improved the presentation drastically. Here is a list of resources he suggests to read:
