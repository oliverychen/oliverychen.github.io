<h2>On Scientific Writing and Presentation</h2>

May 1, 2016

<div style="background-color:black; color:white; padding:20px;">

<p>If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead, either write something worth reading or do things worth writing.</p>

- Benjamin Franklin

<br>
I have been long thinking about writing a blog that puts in order a few resources from which I have benefited immensely in my yet-immature-but-steadily-improving academic writing and presenting career. On one hand, this project serves as a library to which I have an easy access; on the other hand, I hope that some students like myself can benefit from reading the list of articles, essays, and blogs below. This is an on-going project. Please send me recommendations of additional resources that can be included, and please check back every now and then as I update.
<br/>

<br>[This aritical](/files/doc/scientific_writing.pdf) is recommended by Professor [Andreas Buja](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~buja) as "an article everybody should read" on scientific reading. Here is a [summary version](/files/doc/summary.pdf) of it.
<br/>

<br>[The Elements of Style](/files/doc/Style.pdf) teaches concise and vigorous English writing.
<br/>

<br>Professor [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com) gives good advice on effective presentation [here](/files/doc/Presentation_Leek.pdf).
<br/>

<br>As a student studying in the interdisciplinary field between statistics, computer science, and neurosicence, I have learned a great deal from reading the works of Sir R. A. Fisher's, inter alia, the <em>"Statistical Trilogy"</em> : (1) [Statisticcal Methods for Research Workers](/files/Fisher_1.pdf); (2) [The Design of Experiments](/files/Fisher_2.pdf); and (3) [Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference](http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Methods-Scientific-Inference-Ronald/dp/0028447409)
<br/>


<br>In the [Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin](https://archive.org/details/autobiography00franuoft),  Mr.Franklin taught us a few procedures to improve writing:
<li> Read an article </li>
<li> Write short hints about each sentence (you could also outline the piece) and set it aside for awhile </li>
<li> Rewrite the article in his own words</li>
<li> Compare with the original, and</li> 
<li> Revise and improve your essay.</li>
<br />

<br>[Andrew Lee](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/otolaryngology/our_team/residents_fellows.html), MD, suggests that the best thing to do to improve writing skills is read are essays; and read them <b>critically</b>. By critically, he means while reading, think why does the author choose that particular word? What does that word do? Here is a list of additional sources he suggests us to read:

<li> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com">The Atlantic</a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.economist.com">The Economist</a> </li>
