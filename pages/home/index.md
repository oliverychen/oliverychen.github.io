Oliver is a Graduate Fellow student of the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhsph.edu/) Bloomberg School of Public Health under Professor Dr. [Martin Lindquist](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~mlindqui/) and Assistant Professor Dr. [Elizabeth (Betsy) Ogburn](http://www.eogburn.com).

<br />
His primary research interest is in computational neuroscience (an interdisciplinary study of statistics, optimization and neuroscience). For example, consider an fMRI study of thermal pain where we are interested in determining which brain measurements (over 200,000 voxels) mediate the relationship between the application of a thermal stimulus and self-reported pain. He is also interested in functional data analysis, partial correlation estimation and graph estimation, causal inference, experimental design, and problems relating to high dimensional data analysis.
