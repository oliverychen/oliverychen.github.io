Oliver is a Graduate Fellow Ph.D. student of the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhsph.edu/) Bloomberg School of Public Health under Professor Dr. [Martin Lindquist](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~mlindqui/) and Assistant Professor Dr. [Elizabeth (Betsy) Ogburn](http://www.eogburn.com). He also works closely with Professor Dr. [Brian Caffo]() from Hopkins Biostatistics and Assistant Professor Dr. Xiao Luo from the [Department of Statistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [North Carolina State University](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/). He is a member of the [Statistical Methods and Applications for Research in Technology (SMART)](http://www.smart-stats.org) group. Prior to Hopkins, he was a University Fellow graduate student at the [Department of Statistics](http://www.statistics.northwestern.edu) at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu).

<br />
He received his Master's in Theoratical Statistics from the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.math.wsu.edu) at [Washington State University](http://www.wsu.edu); and spread his undergraduate time in the [ECUST Business School](http://bs.ecust.edu.cn:8080/index_news_en.jsp?OID=2-4187912&no=3&nodecode=ysytp&imageindex=1&bar=News) in Shanghai and [Rollins College](http://www.rollins.edu) in Florida, earning a B.S. in Financial Engineering.

His primary research interest is in computational neuroscience (an interdisciplinary study of statistics, computer optimization and neuroscience). For example, in a brain mediation analysis where the mediator consists whole-brain voxels of dimension more than 200,000. He is also interested in functional data analysis, partial correlation estimation and graph estimation, causal inference, experimental design, and problems relating to high dimensional data analysis.
