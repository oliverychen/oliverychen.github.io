## Painting

I have been painting *Gōng-Bi* (工筆) style *watercolor* (aquarelle) for twenty years; I also enjoy *oil painting*. Here are some of my works.

#### Drunk Li-Bai

Li Bai (705 – 762), courtesy name Tài-bái ( literally meaning Venus ), also known as Li Po, and his friend Dù Fu (712 – 770), were the two most prominent poets in the mid-Táng Dynasty that is often called the "Golden Age of China”. His poetry was introduced to Europe circa18th-century by Jean Joseph Marie Amiot in his Portraits des Célèbres Chinois. Further translations were published by Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys in his 1862 Poésies de l'Époque des Thang. The painting delineates a story, probably apocryphal, of Li Bai, during his service at the Royal Hàn-Lín Academy. Once, while drunk, Li Bai (front left) ordered Gāo Lì-Shì (front right), Duke of Qí, the most politically powerful eunuch in the palace, to remove his shoes; and he asked Yáng Guó-Zhōng (second to the right), a cousin of the favorite Imperial Consort Yáng Yü-Huán (back left), and the Chancellor in the reign of Emperor Xuān-Zōng of Táng Dynasty, to grind ink. They took offense, and along with Consort Yáng, persuaded Emperor Xuān-Zōng to send Li Bai away from the royal court.

The painting was painted à la Gōng-bi (工筆) on xüān paper (宣紙, made of Pteroceltis tatarinowii tree bark et al).

## Classical Music

I played *trombone*, *trumpet*, and *Chinese Sornā*; my favorite composer is Debussy, my favorite pianist is Horowitz, and my favorite piece is *Nr. 7, Träumerei* in Schumann's *Kinderszenen, Op.15*, performed by Horowitz at the Moscow Conservatory in 1986.

## Wine
I enjoy collecting and studying red wine, especially when combined with some captivating conversation with my friends.
