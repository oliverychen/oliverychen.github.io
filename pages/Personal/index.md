### Painting

I have been painting *Gōng-Bi* style *watercolor* (aquarelle) for twenty-six years; I also enjoy *oil painting*. Here are some of my works.

Date painted: 2006
Ink on raw Xuan paper, approx. 100 x 100 cm
Technique: Gōng-Bi

  
### Classical Music
 I played *trombone*, *trumpet*, and *Chinese Sornā*; my favorite composer is Debussy, my favorite pianist is Horowitz, and my favorite piece is *Nr. 7, Träumerei* in Schumann's *Kinderszenen, Op.15*, performed by Horowitz at the Moscow Conservatory in 1986.

 
### Wine
I enjoy collecting and studying red wine, especially when combined with some captivating conversation with my friends.
