I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhsph.edu/). I am advised by Professor [Scott Zeger](http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3859/Zeger/Scott), and work closely with [Hopkins inHealth](http://hopkinsinhealth.jhu.edu/) methodology group, [Causal Inference Working Group](http://jhsphcausalinference.weebly.com/), and [International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)](http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/ivac/).

<br />
I conduct statistical research on hierarchical Bayesian latent variable models motivated by and applied to health decisions made for individuals. Broadly, I am interested in discovering simple latent structure representations in complex biomedical data that can improve inferences and decisions about population or individual health. I have also worked on causal inference methods 1) to evaluate novel treatment rules under special designs like matched-pair cluster randomized design, as these designs are useful for interventions that can only be applied at cluster level; and 2) to facilitate the inference for novel estimands and/or semiparametric models by automating and unifying the derivation of efficient influence functions (EIF) and ensuing estimation.


<br />
Currently a major focus of my work is on analysis of multiple mixed-type longitudinal measurements with feedbacks in treatment assignments. I am working on hierarchical Bayesian methods to to infer latent trajectories that represent individual disease progressions that have direct applications to childhood pneumonia etiology studies and disease surveillance.
