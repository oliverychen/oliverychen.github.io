Oliver is a Graduate Fellow Ph.D. student of the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhsph.edu/) Bloomberg School of Public Health under Professor Dr. [Martin Lindquist](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~mlindqui/) and Assistant Professor Dr. [Elizabeth (Betsy) Ogburn](http://www.eogburn.com). He also works closely with Professor Dr. [Brian Caffo]() from Hopkins Biostatistics and Assistant Professor Dr. Xiao Luo from the [Department of Statistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [North Carolina State University](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/). He is a member of the [Statistical Methods and Applications for Research in Technology (SMART)](http://www.smart-stats.org) group. Prior to Hopkins, he was a University Fellow at the [Department of Statistics](http://www.statistics.northwestern.edu) at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu).


<br />
He received his Master's in Theoratical Statistics from the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics] at [Washington State University](http://www.wsu.edu); and spread his undergraduate time in the [ECUST Business School](http://bs.ecust.edu.cn:8080/index_news_en.jsp?OID=2-4187912&no=3&nodecode=ysytp&imageindex=1&bar=News) in Shanghai and [Rollins College](http://www.rollins.edu) in Florida, earning a B.S. in Financial Engineering.


<br />
His primary research interest is in computational neuroscience (an interdisciplinary study of statistics, computer optimization and neuroscience). For example, in a brain mediation analysis where the mediator consists whole-brain voxels of dimension more than 200,000. He is also interested in functional data analysis, partial correlation estimation and graph estimation, causal inferenc, experimental design, and problems relating to high dimensional data analysis. He likes to think about statistics philosophy also, but he usually ends up getting lost before he turns to Socrates or Birnbaum, and gives up thereupon (not because the former died of drinking the poison and the latter committed suicide, but because he figures he is constantly trying to quantify certainty based upon uncertainty, a statistical id√©e fixe). This process, nevertheless, keeps recurring intermittently.
